This Python code uses MediaPipe to track hands and control the mouse cursor. When the index finger and thumb are close together, the code will click the mouse.

Requirements:

1. Python 3
2. OpenCV
3. MediaPipe
4. pyautogui
5. win32ctypes

Usage:

Install the required dependencies.
Run the code.
Move your hand in front of the camera.
The mouse cursor will follow your index finger.
When you want to click the mouse, close your index finger and thumb together.
Tips:

For best results, use a well-lit environment and make sure that your hand is in the camera's view.
You can adjust the sensitivity of the mouse movement by changing the value of the multiplier variable in the code.
You can also adjust the distance between the index finger and thumb that is required to click the mouse by changing the value of the click_threshold variable in the code.
Troubleshooting:

If you are having problems with the code, try the following:

Make sure that you have installed all of the required dependencies.
Make sure that your camera is properly connected to your computer.
Try running the code on a different computer.
If you are still having problems, contact the author (Bethvour Chike ~ Me) for further assistance.
